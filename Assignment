QUESTION 1. Predict the output 
             #include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int x;
cout << "Enter first number\n";
cin >> x; // user will give ‘x’ a value.
int y, m;
cout << "Enter second number and value for taking modulus\n";
cin >> y >> m; // user will give ‘y’ a value.
int Z = (x * y) % m;
cout << "Output is: " << Z;
}
Answer : Output is 0

QUESTION 2. Predict the output 
            #include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int x;
cout<<"Enter first number\n";
cin>>x; // user will give 'x' a value.
int y;
cout<<"Enter second number\n";
cin>>y; // user will give 'y' a value.
cout<<(x!=y)<<" "<<(x>=y);
}
Answer 1 1

Question 3. Predic the output
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int x,y;
cin>>x>>y;
x+=y;
x-=y;
x%=y;
cout<<x;
}
Answer : 2

Question 4.WAP for finding the volume of the cylinder by taking radius and height as input.
Answer : #include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
float  height , radius;
cout <<"ENTER THE HEIGHT OF CYLINDER ";
cin >> height;
cout << "ENTER THE RADIUS OF CYLINDER ";
cin >> radius;
float volume;
volume = 2*3.14*radius*height;
cout << "VOLUME OF CYLINDER IS : " << volume;
}

Question 5. WAP to find the difference between ASCII of two characters ,take them as input .
Answer : #include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
char ch1,ch2;
cout << "enter the first character ";
cin >> ch1;
cout << "enter the second character ";
cin >> ch2;
int ch;
int ch3,ch4;
ch3 = (int)ch1;
ch4 = (int)ch2;
ch = ch3 -ch4 ;
cout << "DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASCII VALUE OF TWO CHARACTER IS : " << ch;
}

Question 6. Find the output of the below code
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
int i = ( 4 + 7 / 5 * 6 * 6+9 )% 100 ;
cout<<i;
}
Answer : 49
